I built the front end for [Young Growth Academy](https://www.younggrowth.academy) which is a tuition centre located in Penrith CBD, teaching Mathematics, English and Science (Junior Science, Biology, Chemistry, Physics) from Years 1 to Year 12. Their inspiring team of teachers help students to focus and excel within the class and take their skills to other domains within society. The underlying value they deliver is in the student’s unparalleled development outside the classroom.

It facilitates the ease of understanding as to how socially responsible individual funds are. Responsible Investing (also known as socially responsible investing, ethical investing, and impact investing) has become a large focus in recent years. I am working with the organisation and a development team to architect a new and innovative microservice used on the backend.

Have you ever wondered if Test-Driven Development actually improves code quality? There is a lot of evidence documented in research papers but this is unavailable to many commercial software engineers because it is behind a paywall, is written in unfamiliar academic language, and requires high effort to find the trends. With [SEER](https://seer-repo.herokuapp.com), you to browse a list of empirical research articles via a simple search for "TDD" and "Code Quality", then view summaries of each evidence related to the study, its measures and the results.
