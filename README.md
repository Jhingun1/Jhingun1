At Save Nemo, the team builds and deploys affordable, self-sustaining mooring buoys in coastal regions worst affected by climate change. These buoys include sensors up and down the mooring to collect data in near-real time and ping the telemetry back via cellular uplink. [Nemo Cloud](https://nemo-pi.com) is the dashboard where our IoT data is made available for monitoring. For our solution we won the Google Social Impact Challenge 2018 and were placed 23rd / 2600 applicants at the Google AI for Social Good Challenge.

Have you ever wondered if Test-Driven Development actually improves code quality? There is a lot of evidence documented in research papers but this is unavailable to many commercial software engineers because it is behind a paywall, is written in unfamiliar academic language, and requires high effort to find the trends. With [SEER](https://seer-repo.herokuapp.com), you to browse a list of empirical research articles via a simple search for "TDD" and "Code Quality", then view summaries of each evidence related to the study, its measures and the results.
